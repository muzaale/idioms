Here's an attempt to restore oral tradition in a world that values the verb `to read` over `to listen`.

The first release of this book will harken to the present time and lay out a few idioms in print for you to read. But the anticipated release of `book 1.2` will append audio and video clips of the authors narrative over the written word in `book 1.0`, as was done in all societies from the beginning of time.

One may talk of an `anci√©n regime`. Another of a `zeitgeist`. Still another of `biding ones time.` It may seem to some that I belong to an earlier epoch in Uganda's history since I was born in 1939 whereas our nation gained independence in 1961. But I'll persuade you otherwise using todays zeitgeist -- including  tools such as this self-published .html book -- that oral tradition is making a long overdue comeback. Yes, I did bide my time over the last few decades as I watched trends come and go in the world of publishing. But my time has finally come. And I will use it to share what I've always wanted to convey to the next generation.
