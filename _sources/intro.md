Here's an attempt to restore oral tradition in a world that values the verb `to read` over `to listen`.

The first release of this book will harken to the present time and lay out a few idioms in print for you to read. But the anticipated release 1.2 will append audio and video clips of the author narrative the written word, as it was done in all societies from the beginning of time.

One may talk of an `anci√©n regime`. Another of a `zeitgeist`. Still another of `biding ones time.` It may seem to some that I belong to an earlier epoch in Uganda's history since I was born in 1939 whereas our nation gained independence in 1961. But I'll persuade you otherwise using todays zeitgeist, including  tools such as this self-published .html book, that oral tradition is making a long overdue comeback. Yes, I did bide my time over the last few decades as I watched trends come and go in the world of publishing. But my time has finally come to share what I've always wanted to share.
