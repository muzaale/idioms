It's been quite an ache
Going about trying to bake
A tasty sweet poetry cake
For you to partake

And for all my pains
There's hardly been any gains
Except for what here reigns:
Poetry with no brains!

Forgive me if I put you to sleep
Because you read these rhymes
Pardon me if you hereby weep 
For the poetry of our times:

I am but a doctor:
A poet with no mentor;
About to enter--
Something beyond my mental
